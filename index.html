            <section>
              Plants prevent soil erosion and desertification. Plants provide
              the raw materials for food, clothing, medicines, construction and
              many other products that sustain our lives. Plants enhance our
              quality of life â€“ they add variety and beauty to our surroundings.
              So to take care of plants and environment we have taken the
              initiative.
